# Amazon Product Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes product-wise sales performance, marketing spend efficiency, and inventory status for an Amazon product portfolio.  
The goal is to help business decision-makers identify high-performing products, optimize inventory, and improve marketing ROI.

##  Key Business Questions
- Which products contribute the most to total revenue & profit?
- Which region is performing the best in terms of average profit?
- How effectively is the marketing budget being utilized across products?
- Which products are at risk due to **low inventory stock**?
- What is the **ROI (Return on Investment)** per product category?

##  Dashboard Insights (Summary)

| Metric | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| **Top Selling Product** | LED Bulb |
| **Total Units Sold** | 961 |
| **Total Profit Generated** | $2.04K |
| **Total Marketing Spend** | $1.07K |
| **Highest Profit Region** | North Region |
| **Lowest Inventory Product** | (Product name from inventory analysis) |

### Key Insights for Business Decision-Making
- **LED Bulb** and **Water Bottle** drive majority of profit → consider increasing ad spend & bulk procurement.
- **East region** is underperforming → opportunity for sales campaign or re-pricing.
- Certain products are nearing **low stock level** → reorder to avoid lost revenue.
- **Phone Case and Wireless Mouse** show good ROI despite moderate sales → consider scalable marketing.
